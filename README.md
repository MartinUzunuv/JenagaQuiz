MERN multiplayer game
Long story short this is a school project that i took way too far.
I've included .bat files to start the project.
After you run both .bat files, open http://localhost:3000/ at your browser.
You'll be wellcomed by a login window. Press "Sign in" and create an account (for example test1 with password 111).
Login with your new acount and in "Party code", write some random code or word or whatever(for example 123abc) and click join party.
If a party with this code doesn't exist, the game will create a new party and if it does, you will join the already existing party.
But since you are logged from only one window, you will have to open http://localhost:3000/ at a new tab, without closing the old one.
Then you repeat the process(for example test2 with password 222) and join the already existing party(123abc).
I reccomend you find a way to see both tabs at the same time.
From test1 tab, press START GAME.
The rules are simple. If it's your turn, answer the question correctly and if you fail to answer, you will have to remove a wooden block.
To remove a block, press on it.
You can also create questions from the join party window.
!!!WARNING!!! The game isn't finished yet and the security is very weak.
Also the entire game losing system isn't functuonal.
The questions are stupid becouse my friends wrote them.
